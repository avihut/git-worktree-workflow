  Guides the daft worktree workflow for compartmentalized Git development. Use
  when working in daft-managed repositories (repos with a .git/ bare directory
  and branch worktrees as sibling directories), when setting up worktree
  environment isolation, or when users ask about worktree-based workflows.
  Covers daft commands, hooks automation via daft.yml, and environment tooling
  like mise, direnv, nvm, and pyenv.

# daft Worktree Workflow

## Core Philosophy

daft treats each Git worktree as a **compartmentalized workspace**, not just a
branch checked out to disk. Each worktree is a fully isolated environment with
its own:

- Working files and Git index
- Build artifacts (`node_modules/`, `target/`, `venv/`, `.build/`)
- IDE state and configuration (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
- Environment files (`.envrc`, `.env`)
- Running processes (dev servers, watchers, test runners)
- Installed dependencies (potentially different versions per branch)

Creating a worktree is spinning up a new development environment, not just
"checking out a branch". Split that work along two lifecycles:

- **Provision on create.** `daft.yml` lifecycle hooks do finite, idempotent,
  unattended setup — install dependencies, copy env files, configure environment
  tools — so the developer can start working immediately.
- **Serve on demand.** Long-running, attended processes — dev servers,
  `docker compose` stacks, watchers — belong in **tasks**, started explicitly
  with `daft run`. Booting a backend stack in every worktree you only ever read
  wastes resources and invites port collisions.

The same job schema powers both; only the trigger differs (a lifecycle event vs.
an explicit `daft run`). See Tasks (`daft run`) below.

Never use `git checkout` or `git switch` to change branches in a daft-managed
repo. Navigate between worktree directories instead.

## Detecting a daft-Managed Repository

daft supports multiple layouts. The most common is the **contained** layout:

```
my-project/
+-- .git/                    # Bare repository (shared Git metadata)
+-- main/                    # Worktree for the default branch
|   +-- src/
|   +-- package.json
+-- feature/auth/            # Worktree for a feature branch
|   +-- src/
|   +-- package.json
```

Key indicators of any daft-managed repository:

- `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` from any worktree finds the shared Git
  directory
- `daft layout show` reports which layout the repo uses
- Contained layout: `.git/` at the project root is a **bare repository**
  (directory, not a file) with branch worktrees as siblings
- Other layouts: the main checkout looks like a normal Git repo, but daft
  manages worktrees elsewhere

If you see any of these patterns, the user is using daft. Apply worktree-aware
guidance throughout the session.

Four built-in layouts control where worktrees are placed:

| Layout        | Template                                                            | Description                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `contained`   | `{{ repo_path }}/{{ branch }}`                                      | Worktrees inside the repo directory   |
| `sibling`     | `{{ repo }}.{{ branch \| sanitize }}`                               | Worktrees next to the repo (default)  |
| `nested`      | `{{ repo }}/.worktrees/{{ branch \| sanitize }}`                    | Worktrees in a hidden subdirectory    |
| `centralized` | `{{ daft_data_dir }}/worktrees/{{ repo }}/{{ branch \| sanitize }}` | Worktrees in a central data directory |

Manage layouts with `daft layout show` / `list` / `transform <layout>` /
`default [layout]`. Layout is selected at clone time by `--layout`, then the
`daft.yml` `layout:` field, then the global default, then the built-in default
(sibling); custom template layouts live in `~/.config/daft/config.toml`.

`daft layout transform` moves the branch checked out in the main working tree,
whatever it is — not the default branch. If the default branch has no worktree
it keeps having none; daft reports that rather than creating one. It carries any
working-tree state (modified, staged, untracked, ignored, conflicted entries):
per-worktree git state is relocated, nothing is stashed, and there is no
`--force`. It refuses only a paused rebase/am/merge/cherry-pick/revert/bisect in
the worktree that changes role (plus an `index.lock`, checked-out submodules, or
a `git worktree lock`), reporting every blocker at once with both settle
commands; `--dry-run` lists them. `--pivot <branch>` and `--as <dir>` are the
flag twins of the two questions it would otherwise ask (which worktree takes the
repository root of a bare repo; what to name a detached main working tree's
directory), and `-y` accepts the `--as` default and the cross-volume copy
confirmation — never a pivot. Always pass the flags when running
non-interactively.

`daft.yml` can pin the team-recommended layout alongside hooks:

```yaml
layout: contained

hooks:
  worktree-post-create:
    jobs:
      - name: install-deps
        run: npm install
```

## Running daft

### Execution rule

Run and recommend daft commands using the short verbs exactly as written in this
file: `daft go`, `daft start`, `daft clone`, `daft init`, `daft carry`,
`daft exec`, `daft run`, `daft merge`, `daft list`, `daft update`, `daft prune`,
`daft remove`, `daft rename`, `daft sync`, `daft push`, plus the noun groups
`daft hooks ...`, `daft repo ...`, `daft layout ...`, `daft config ...`,
`daft doctor`, and `daft skill ...`. Invoke the `daft` binary directly.

Never run or emit the alternate spellings some users have configured:
`git worktree-*` subcommands, `git-worktree-*` binaries, long `daft worktree-*`
names, `git daft ...`, or shortcut aliases such as `gwtco`. They depend on
symlinks and shell wrappers that are usually absent from agent shells, and the
daft verbs are the canonical register. This applies to commands you execute and
to commands you write in explanations, docs, scripts, and `daft.yml` suggestions
alike.

### Recognizing user vocabulary

Users may still type those alternate spellings in their own terminals. Translate
what they say into daft verbs; respond and act in daft verbs. It is fine to
acknowledge their form once ("`gwtco` runs `daft go`").

| User says or types                                   | Means                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `git worktree-checkout`, `gwtco`, `gwco`, `gcw`      | `daft go`                           |
| `git worktree-checkout -b`, `gwtcb`, `gwcob`, `gcbw` | `daft start`                        |
| `gwtcm`, `gwtcbm`, `gwcobd`, `gcbdw`                 | `daft start` off the default branch |
| `git worktree-clone`, `gwtclone`, `gclone`           | `daft clone`                        |
| `git worktree-init`, `gwtinit`                       | `daft init`                         |
| `git worktree-carry`, `gwtcarry`                     | `daft carry`                        |
| `git worktree-warm`                                  | `daft warm`                         |
| `git worktree-exec`                                  | `daft exec`                         |
| `git worktree-merge`                                 | `daft merge`                        |
| `git worktree-list`, `gwtls`                         | `daft list`                         |
| `git worktree-fetch`, `gwtfetch`                     | `daft update`                       |
| `git worktree-prune`, `gwtprune`, `gprune`           | `daft prune`                        |
| `git worktree-branch -d` / `-D`, `gwtbd`             | `daft remove` / `daft remove -f`    |
| `git worktree-branch -m`, `gwtrn`                    | `daft rename`                       |
| `git worktree-sync`, `gwtsync`                       | `daft sync`                         |
| `git worktree-push`, `gwtpush`                       | `daft push`                         |
| `git daft <noun> ...` (e.g. `git daft hooks trust`)  | `daft <noun> ...`                   |

The long `daft worktree-<name>` spellings map the same way. Shortcut aliases are
optional symlinks users manage with `daft activate shortcuts`; never execute
them yourself.

### If a documented command is rejected

If `daft` rejects a command or flag documented here (unknown subcommand,
unexpected argument), do not fall back to raw `git worktree` plumbing.

1. Re-discover the real surface: `daft --help`, then `daft <command> --help`.
2. The installed copy of this skill may be stale relative to the installed
   binary. Refresh it with `daft skill install`, which writes the
   version-matched skill embedded in the `daft` binary (compare `daft --version`
   with `daft_version` in this file's frontmatter).
3. Proceed with the syntax `--help` reports.

### Operating across worktrees: `-C <path>`

Every daft command accepts a top-level `-C <path>` flag that changes the
effective working directory before any path-dependent state is resolved (repo
discovery, layout, hooks, `daft.yml`). Semantics match `git -C`.

```bash
daft -C /path/to/repo list           # equivalent to: cd /path/to/repo && daft list
daft -C /path/to/repo go feature/x   # creates the worktree inside that repo
```

This is the recommended pattern for agents working across multiple worktrees:
each command is self-contained ("do X in path Y") with no `cd` juggling. Rules:
repeated flags compose like `git -C` (`-C /a -C b` means `/a/b` — not "last
wins"); relative arguments resolve against the post-`-C` cwd; `-C` is parsed
only at the front of the argv, so an inner `-C` in a `daft exec` shell command
is preserved.

### daft does not change your shell's directory

The daft binary cannot `cd` the parent shell. After creating a worktree,
navigate to it explicitly — sibling worktrees live at `../<branch>/` relative to
any worktree. (Users with shell integration installed get automatic cd via
`DAFT_CD_FILE` wrappers; agent shells do not have those wrappers.)

When a user asks why their terminal did not follow a new worktree, point them at
shell integration: `eval "$(daft shell-init bash)"` in `~/.bashrc` or
`~/.zshrc`, `daft shell-init fish | source` for fish. Opt out per command with
`--no-cd` or globally with `git config daft.autocd false`. Agents recommend
these lines; they never eval them.

### `daft repo remove --purge` and `daft repo move` invalidate your cwd

Running `daft repo remove --purge` from inside the repo being deleted, or
`daft repo move` from inside the repo being moved, invalidates the agent's cwd
mid-operation. Either pass an explicit target and stay outside
(`daft repo remove --purge /path/to/repo`, `daft repo move api ~/Work/api` run
from elsewhere), or `cd` to a safe ancestor first. The binary writes a redirect
path to `$DAFT_CD_FILE` for shell wrappers, but agent shells typically lack that
wrapper, so follow-up commands fail with `chdir: no such file or directory`
until the cwd is fixed. After a move the new location is the one to `cd` into.

Removal without `--purge` is safe: the default deletes nothing, so the cwd stays
valid. A move has no such mode — it always relocates the files.

## Command Reference

All commands run from any directory inside any worktree; daft finds the project
root via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`.

Naming no target warms the current worktree, naming one warms that one; `--from` names the source outright and is never second-guessed. Without it the source is ranked: a worktree sitting at the target's exact commit first, then where you stand, then the default branch's worktree. Each slot takes a worktree directory name, branch name, or path. Entries already present in the target are skipped unless `--force`, which still refuses content the target tracks. The result line names both resolved worktrees at ordinary verbosity. One worktree per run — no fleet form. Does not change your shell's directory, except when `--force` replaces the directory you are standing in — then it moves you to the target worktree's root. See Warm Worktrees below. |

Rebase and push apply only to branches you own by default; `--include` widens (`unowned`, an email, or a branch name). `-f`/`--prune-dirty` includes dirty worktrees. Parallel hook-bearing pushes are memory-governed (`--jobs N` caps concurrency, `--no-throttle` disables). First Ctrl+C cancels gracefully (partial results print, exit 130); a second force-kills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Daft's own job variables answer too — `daft env DAFT_BRANCH_NAME` prints the live value of any of the seven that exist at rest, and the rest (`DAFT_HOOK`, `DAFT_COMMIT`, `DAFT_MERGE_*`, …) error explaining when they exist; serializing them is refused, so `--export`/`--write`/`--format` stay the declared set. |

By default the entry is tombstoned and NOTHING on disk is touched — no hooks, no prompt, and it works on a stale entry whose directory is already gone. `--purge` also deletes the git dir and every worktree, running `worktree-pre-remove`/`worktree-post-remove` per worktree (`post-remove` fires AFTER the directory is gone) and prompting unless `--force`; `--force` is `--purge`-only. `<repo>` is a catalog name, uuid, or path (`.`, a subdirectory, a directory); a bare name resolves as a catalog name first, so `./x` insists on a directory.

Worktrees the layout places outside the repo directory move too (that is ALL of them under the default `sibling` layout); a worktree placed by hand stays put and is repaired in place. `--name` also renames the catalog entry; without it the name follows the directory when it was derived from it. Never use plain `mv` on a daft repo — it breaks all of the above and reports nothing.

For ad-hoc commands across worktrees use `daft exec`; for named tasks committed
in `daft.yml` (dev servers, compose stacks) use `daft run`; for recurring
lifecycle automation use `daft.yml` hooks.

### Repo Catalog and the Graph

daft keeps a machine-local **repo catalog** — every repo it touches registers
automatically (clone, init, or any daft command run inside it). Names derive
from the remote URL; collisions auto-suffix (`api`, `api-2`).

Local resolution wins: a branch named like a repo shadows it (use `--repo`). A catalog match beats `daft.go.autoStart`. Works outside any git repo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `daft go <repo> <branch>`                                  | Open a branch's worktree in another repo (created on demand); `daft go --repo <name> [-b <branch> [base]]` is the explicit form. After a hop, `daft go -` returns to the source worktree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `daft start <repo> <branch> [base]`                        | Create a NEW branch in another cataloged repo, based on its default branch unless `[base]` is given. Local-first, first match wins: an existing local branch named `<repo>` keeps the local reading; a `<branch>` slot that already resolves to a ref here is read as a base (so `daft start api release-2` creates local branch `api`); naming your own repo stays local. `daft start --repo <name> <branch>` is the explicit form that always crosses. The destination is announced before any work; the target's trust gates its hooks; `-x` runs there, `-c` is refused. |
| `daft exec --repo <name> \| --all-repos [...]`             | Run commands in another repo's worktrees, or across every cataloged repo's default-branch worktree (rows labeled `repo:branch`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `daft exec --related [...]`                                | Run across the current repo and its relations, targeting each repo's worktree for the current branch; repos lacking it are skipped with a notice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `daft start <branch> --with-related`                       | Create the same branch in the current repo and every related repo (each from its own default branch). Related repos must be cloned; hooks run only where trusted; `--carry`/`-x` stay local. `daft start <repo> <branch> --with-related` roots the fan-out at that repo's manifest instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `daft list\|update\|prune\|doctor --repo <name>`           | Run the command in another cataloged repo from anywhere; `--all-repos` sweeps every live entry. `daft list <repo>` is positional sugar (repo-only resolution — a miss is a hard error, never a branch fallback).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `daft remove --repo <name> <branch...>`                    | Remove branches in another cataloged repo. Flag-only by design — the positional slot is a variadic list of branch names or paths, so `daft remove api feature-x` always means "remove both branches here" and is never reinterpreted as a repo. The destination is announced before any work; your shell is never relocated (the removal is elsewhere); no `--all-repos`. Passing a worktree path with `--repo` is an error — the path already names its repo.                                                                                                               |
| `daft hooks jobs --repo <name\|path\|uuid>`                | Inspect another repo's hook-job history — including removed repos, whose logs stay addressable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `daft clone <name>`                                        | Re-clone a cataloged (typically removed) repo from its recorded remote URL. `daft repo remove` tombstones the entry, so removal is reversible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Cross-repo edges are committed in `daft.yml` under a top-level `relations:` key
— `url:` required (matched against the catalog by normalized URL, so the
manifest is portable), `name:`/`kind:` optional, edges directed. Manage them
with `daft repo link`/`daft repo unlink` rather than hand-editing:

```yaml
relations:
  - url: git@github.com:acme/api-client.git
    name: client
    kind: consumer
```

### Post-setup command execution (`-x`/`--exec`)

`daft clone`, `daft init`, `daft go`, and `daft start` accept repeatable
`-x`/`--exec` commands that run sequentially in the new worktree after hooks
complete, stopping on first failure. Interactive programs work — stdio is fully
inherited.

```bash
daft clone https://github.com/org/repo -x 'mise install'
daft start my-feature -x claude
```

Use `-x` for finite setup steps. To start a long-running process (a dev server,
a compose stack, a watcher), define a task and run it on demand with `daft run`
— see Tasks (`daft run`).

## Anonymous Worktrees (sandboxes and forks)

Worktrees decoupled from branches: detached-HEAD checkouts with hooks run and
environment set up, living exactly as long as their directory. Two commands
create them, and choosing between them is a decision rule, not a preference:

- **Visit — `daft go <commit-ish>`** when you need to _look at_ a point in
  history (build an old release, inspect a tag, reproduce a PR's "before" state)
  and sharing is fine. Idempotent: the first visit materializes the canonical
  sandbox for that commit, every later visit — by any spelling — lands in the
  same worktree, environment warm.
- **Mint — `daft start --fork [<base>]`** when you need a _private_ worktree to
  run work in without colliding with anyone (or anything) else, or when you need
  several. Always fresh: run it twice, get two. Never matched by `go`'s
  resolution — a fork is reachable only by its printed name.

The fork contract is built for agents: **stdout is the created path** (one per
line under `-n`), narration is stderr, so capture is the whole integration:

```bash
wt=$(daft start --fork)                       # one private worktree at HEAD
wt=$(daft start origin/master --fork)         # ...at master's current position
daft start --fork -n 3 -x './rebuild.sh'      # three, each built, paths on stdout
```

Parallel agents each run their own `--fork` — names are claimed atomically, so
concurrent invocations never collide and need no coordination. Do NOT share one
worktree between parallel agents, and do NOT fall back to raw
`git worktree add --detach`: it skips hooks and produces a half-configured
checkout that cannot build.

Aftercare contract:

- These worktrees have **no branch and no upstream — never push from one.**
- Remove with `daft remove <name>` (the printed path's basename) when done.
  Wildcards sweep a fleet: `daft remove 'main-fork*'` (quote the pattern — daft
  expands it against sandbox names; it never matches branches, and a pattern
  matching nothing errors).
- Commits made inside are safe while the worktree exists, but die with it:
  removal refuses when HEAD moved off the pinned commit. Two routes keep the
  work. **Promote** when it deserves a branch: `daft start <new-branch>` from
  inside the sandbox bases the new branch on the detached HEAD. **Merge back**
  when adopting it into the branch you forked from: a fork's HEAD is a legal
  merge source, spelled `worktrees/<dirname>/HEAD` — so
  `daft merge worktrees/<dirname>/HEAD --into <branch>` adopts one fork, several
  sources octopus-merge a fleet at once, and `git cherry-pick <sha>` adopts
  single commits. After either route the commits are reachable elsewhere, so
  `daft remove <dirname> -f` is safe — the `-f` acknowledges the moved pin,
  which removal cannot verify on its own.
- Sandboxes show in `daft list` under their directory name with a dim `○`;
  `prune` and `sync` skip them.

Naming: forks follow `daft.start.forkNaming` — `derived` (default:
`<source>-fork`, `-fork-2`, …) or `memorable` (`brave-otter`). Visit sandboxes
name themselves after stable spellings (`v1.18.0`, `origin-master`) and after a
commit-hex prefix for positional spellings like `HEAD~2`.

## Merging Across Worktrees (`daft merge`)

`daft merge` performs `git merge` without forcing you to `git switch` into the
target branch: land a feature into `main` while staying in your worktree,
octopus-merge several sources, or script merges (`-y` auto-accepts prompts).

```bash
daft merge feature/api --no-edit                      # into the current worktree's branch
daft merge feature/api --into main --no-edit          # into another worktree; shell stays put
daft merge feat/a feat/b --into main --no-edit        # octopus: several sources, one commit
daft merge --squash feature/api --no-edit             # squash all source commits into one
daft merge --rebase feature/api --into main           # rebase source, then fast-forward (linear)
daft merge --rebase-merge feature/api --into main --no-edit  # rebase, then merge commit
daft merge -s ours --into release feature/old --no-edit      # git merge strategy flags
daft merge feature/done --into main -r --no-edit      # remove source worktree + branch on success
daft merge feature/done --into main -r --squash --set-default --no-edit  # persist style + cleanup
daft merge feature/hotfix --into release/1.2 --adopt-target --no-edit    # ephemeral target worktree
daft merge --continue|--abort|--quit [<worktree>]     # finish or bail out
```

Pitfalls to communicate to the user:

- **Default style is always-merge-commit** (never fast-forward, unlike plain
  `git merge`). Use `--rebase` for linear history. Always pass `--no-edit` in CI
  or non-TTY contexts to avoid an editor prompt.
- **`--squash` commits by default**, opening an editor pre-populated with the
  squash message. `--no-edit` uses it verbatim, `-m` supplies your own,
  `--no-commit` stages without committing (incompatible with `-r`). Without a
  TTY and without `--no-edit`/`-m`, daft refuses before merging.
- **The target must be clean** (`daft.merge.requireCleanTarget`, default true).
  Commit, stash, or `daft carry <target>` the changes first.
- **Conflicts do not hijack the shell**: daft reports the conflicted files and
  the exact command to finish. Resolve in the target worktree, `git add`, then
  `daft merge --continue [<target>]`; bail with `daft merge --abort [<target>]`.
- **Squash-staged state**: closing the squash editor without saving leaves the
  changes staged. `daft merge --continue` re-opens the editor;
  `daft merge --abort` resets the index.
- **Octopus aborts on conflict** — multi-source merges are all-or-nothing.
- **`-r` removes both worktree and branch.** Regular merges use safe
  `git branch -d` semantics; squash uses force-delete backed by daft's
  content-equivalence proof. If the source branch moved during the editor
  session, cleanup is refused with a hint.
- **Ephemeral targets**: when the target branch has no worktree, daft prompts;
  `--adopt-target` accepts, `--no-adopt-target` refuses, and
  `daft.merge.adoptTargetOnDemand` (`prompt`/`yes`/`no`) sets the default.

`pre-merge` and `post-merge` hooks fire around the merge with `DAFT_MERGE_*` env
vars (see Hook Types below).

### Merge Gate Policy

A repo can commit a merge quality boundary in `daft.yml` — enforced natively by
`daft merge`, before pre-merge hooks fire and re-verified when the ref moves (so
the tree the hooks tested is the tree that lands):

```yaml
merge:
  ff: only # refuse merges that cannot fast-forward
  source_worktree: clean # source worktree must exist and be clean
```

The gated workflow is rebase-first: rebase the track onto the target, let the
pre-merge rings run, then `daft merge` (now fast-forward-equivalent). With
pre-merge hooks configured, octopus merges are refused — one track at a time.
Flags mirror the config: `--ff-only` / `--source-worktree clean` supply the
policy on unconfigured repos; `--no-ff-only` / `--source-worktree any` relax a
committed policy for one invocation (announced). If a merge is refused with
"advanced while the merge gate ran", the track moved mid-gate — re-run the
merge. These refusals are policy, not errors to work around; do not retry with
relax flags unless the user explicitly decides to override team policy.

## Hooks System (daft.yml)

Hooks automate worktree lifecycle events, configured in a `daft.yml` file at the
repository root.

### Hook Types

| Hook                   | Trigger                                         | Runs From                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `post-clone`           | After `daft clone`                              | New default branch worktree |
| `worktree-pre-create`  | Before new worktree is added                    | Source worktree             |
| `worktree-post-create` | After new worktree is created                   | New worktree                |
| `worktree-pre-remove`  | Before worktree is removed                      | Worktree being removed      |
| `worktree-post-remove` | After worktree is removed                       | Current worktree            |
| `pre-merge`            | After pre-flight checks, before the merge runs  | Target worktree             |
| `post-merge`           | After the merge completes (success or conflict) | Target worktree             |

`worktree-pre-remove`/`worktree-post-remove` also fire when `daft merge -r`
cleans up a merged source worktree; there `DAFT_COMMAND=merge` (not
`branch-delete`), so scripts can tell merge cleanup from a standalone
`daft remove`.

During `daft clone`, `post-clone` fires first (one-time repo bootstrap), then
`worktree-post-create` (per-worktree setup) — so `post-clone` can install
foundational tools the per-worktree hooks depend on.

A failing `worktree-post-create` aborts the creation command by default: the
command exits non-zero and skips its `-x`/`--exec` commands, but the new
worktree stays on disk. Fix the cause, then
`daft hooks run worktree-post-create` from inside that worktree to finish setup
— do not treat the worktree as missing.
`git config daft.hooks.worktreePostCreate.failMode warn` opts back into
continue-on-failure; a repo can also commit `fail_mode: warn` (or `abort`) on a
hook in `daft.yml` to ship that default to every clone, with the git config
taking precedence over the committed value.

`pre-merge` aborts the merge on failure; `post-merge` warns but never rolls
back. Both expose `DAFT_MERGE_*` env vars: `SOURCES`, `TARGET_BRANCH`,
`TARGET_PATH`, `MODE` (`merge`/`ff`/`squash`/`octopus`), `STRATEGY`,
`EPHEMERAL`, `CROSS_WORKTREE`, `SOURCE_SHAS` (source tips captured before the
merge). `post-merge` adds `RESULT`
(`success`/`conflict`/`already-up-to-date`/`aborted`), `COMMIT_SHA`,
`CONFLICTED_FILES`, `PROMOTED_FROM_EPHEMERAL`. `RESULT=aborted` fires when a
squash commit is abandoned (editor closed without saving, pre-commit hook fail,
GPG-sign fail) and `COMMIT_SHA` is then empty. Neither hook fires on a no-op
merge (already up to date).

### daft.yml Format

```yaml
min_version: "1.5.0" # Optional: minimum daft version
env: # Optional: derived per-worktree values (see `daft env`)
  salt: myapp # Pin for identical values across machines
  ports:
    - WEBAPP_PORT # offset 0; bare names auto-increment
    - API_PORT: 8 # explicit offset
  values:
    COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME: "myapp-{worktree_slug}"
hooks:
  worktree-post-create:
    parallel: true # Run jobs concurrently (default)
    jobs:
      - name: install-deps
        run: npm install
      - name: setup-env
        run: cp .env.example .env
```

Keep `env.ports` append-only (inserting mid-list renumbers later offsets).
Top-level `env:` declares derived values; a job-level `env:` is a literal map;
`skip:`/`only:` `env:` is a truthiness predicate — nesting depth disambiguates.

### Config File Locations (first match wins)

`daft.yml`, `daft.yaml`, `.daft.yml`, `.daft.yaml`, `.config/daft.yml`,
`.config/daft.yaml`. Additionally: `daft.local.yml` for machine-specific
overrides (not committed) and per-hook files like `worktree-post-create.yml`.
The deprecated name `daft-local.yml` still works for one release cycle but warns
(and doctor flags it); prefer `daft.local.yml`.

### Execution Modes

Set one per hook (default is `parallel`):

| Mode     | Field            | Behavior                          |
| -------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Parallel | `parallel: true` | All jobs run concurrently         |
| Piped    | `piped: true`    | Sequential; stop on first failure |

### Job Fields

```yaml
- name: job-name # Display name and dependency reference
  description: "Install npm dependencies" # Human-readable description
  run: "npm install" # Inline command (or use script: "setup.sh")
  runner: "bash" # Interpreter for script files
  root: "frontend" # Working directory relative to worktree
  env: # Extra environment variables
    NODE_ENV: development
  tags: ["build"] # Tags for filtering
  skip: CI # Skip when $CI is set
  only: DEPLOY_ENABLED # Only run when $DEPLOY_ENABLED is set
  arch: x86_64 # Target arch: x86_64, aarch64 (or list). No `os:` field —
  # make run: an OS-keyed map (macos/linux/windows) to target an OS; a job
  # with no entry for the current one is skipped.
  needs: [install-npm] # Wait for these jobs to complete first
  tracks: [path, branch] # Worktree attributes this job depends on (move hooks)
  interactive: true # Needs TTY (forces sequential)
  priority: 1 # Lower runs first
  fail_text: "Setup failed" # Custom failure message
  background: true # Run in the background (non-blocking)
  background_output: log # "log" (default) or "silent"
  log: # Log configuration
    retention: "7d" # How long to keep logs
    path: "./logs/job.log" # Custom log path (absolute or relative)
```

### Job Dependencies

```yaml
hooks:
  worktree-post-create:
    jobs:
      - name: install-npm
        run: npm install
      - name: install-pip
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: build
        run: npm run build
        needs: [install-npm]
```

Independent jobs run in parallel; dependent jobs wait for their dependencies.

### Background Jobs

Jobs with `background: true` run asynchronously after the command returns, so
the user can start working while long-running tasks complete. A coordinator
process manages them and writes output to log files.

- Background jobs participate in the DAG: a foreground job depending on a
  background job promotes it to foreground automatically.
- `needs:` between background jobs is honored — the coordinator schedules them
  in topological wave order.
- If a dependency fails or is cancelled, the dependent job is recorded as
  `Skipped` in `daft hooks jobs` listings.
- `background: true` at the hook level sets the default for all its jobs.
- `--hooks <auto|foreground|background|off>` picks how a run's hook phase
  executes, on every command that fires hooks: `go`, `start`, `clone`, `merge`.
  `foreground` runs background jobs inline and waits (CI, debugging); a promoted
  job's failure then fails the hook, which for `worktree-post-create` aborts the
  command. `background` detaches the whole phase, but only where that changes
  nothing but timing: it declines for a phase daft still acts on (every `pre-*`
  gate, `post-clone`, and `post-merge` when the merge used an ephemeral worktree
  or `--remove-branch`) and for a phase declaring an execution order background
  jobs cannot preserve (`parallel: false`, `piped:`, `follow:` — express it with
  `needs:` instead). A declined phase runs inline and daft says so. `off` is
  exactly `--skip-hooks all`, and is the only mode that also affects legacy
  `.daft/hooks/*` scripts. All of it is orthogonal to `--skip-hooks`, which
  picks _which_ jobs run, so the two compose. `DAFT_NO_BACKGROUND_JOBS=1`
  promotes for commands without the flag. Promoted jobs keep the standard job
  timeout.
- `daft hooks jobs` lists, cancels, retries, and prunes records; removing a
  worktree cancels its running background jobs.

When generating `daft.yml`, mark jobs `background: true` when they warm caches,
pre-build, or do other work whose results are not needed immediately.

### Groups

A job can contain a nested group with its own execution mode:

```yaml
- name: checks
  group:
    parallel: true
    jobs:
      - name: lint
        run: cargo clippy
      - name: format
        run: cargo fmt --check
```

### Template Variables

Available in job `run`/`script` commands and in job `env:` values, for lifecycle
hooks and `daft run` tasks alike:

| Variable              | Description                                                                                                                                            |

| `{base_branch}`       | Base branch (branch-creating commands)                                                                                                                 |
| `{repository_url}`    | Repository URL (post-clone)                                                                                                                            |

| `{old_worktree_path}` | Previous worktree path (move hooks only)                                                                                                               |
| `{old_branch}`        | Previous branch name (move hooks only)                                                                                                                 |
| `{merge_source_path}` | Merge hooks: source worktree path (single worktree-backed source); legal in `root:` to run rings in the source worktree, fail-closed when unresolvable |
| `{merge_target_path}` | Merge hooks: target worktree path                                                                                                                      |
| `{changed_files}`     | File-aware jobs: the filtered changed-file list, shell-quoted                                                                                          |

`{worktree_slug}` is the worktree's name relative to the project root,
lowercased and reduced to `[a-z0-9-]` (max 63 chars) — safe for `docker compose`
project names, DB schema names, and temp dirs. Keyed off the worktree, not the
branch, so it is unique per worktree. Use it to make per-worktree names
collision-free: `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME: "api-{worktree_slug}"`.

### Skip and Only Conditions

```yaml
skip: CI # Skip when env var is truthy
skip: true # Always skip
skip:
  - merge # Skip during merge
  - rebase # Skip during rebase
  - ref: "release/*" # Skip if branch matches glob
  - env: SKIP_HOOKS # Skip if env var is truthy
  - run: "test -f .skip-hooks" # Skip if command exits 0
    desc: "Skip file exists" # Human-readable reason
  - changed: "docs/**" # Skip if a changed file matches (merge hooks)

only:
  - env: DEPLOY_ENABLED # Only run when env var is set
  - ref: "main" # Only run on main branch
  - changed: "src/**" # Only run when a matching file changed
```

### Changed-File Job Filters (glob)

A job can gate itself on what the operation changed. For merge hooks the changed
set is the files the sources changed relative to the target (`target...source`);
other hook types need a `files:` command.

```yaml
hooks:
  pre-merge:
    jobs:
      - name: build-check
        glob: ["src/**", "Cargo.*"] # run only when these changed
        run: cargo check --all-targets
      - name: lint-changed
        glob: "*.{js,ts}"
        exclude: ["web/generated/**"] # exclude wins over glob
        run: eslint {changed_files} # expands to the filtered list
```

Patterns match repository-root-relative paths (doublestar rules: `**` spans zero
or more directories, `*` stops at `/`; `root:` is ignored). When nothing
matches, the job is **skipped** with a recorded reason — a docs-only merge skips
the build ring. `glob:`/`exclude:`/`{changed_files}` on a hook type with no
changed set and no `files:` command is a loud configuration error.

### Trust Management

Hooks from untrusted repos do not run automatically. Manage trust with:

```bash
daft hooks trust        # Allow hooks to run
daft hooks prompt       # Prompt before each execution
daft hooks deny         # Never run hooks (default)
daft hooks status       # Check current trust level
daft hooks install      # Scaffold a daft.yml with placeholders
daft hooks validate     # Validate configuration syntax
daft hooks dump         # Show fully merged configuration
daft hooks run <type>   # Manually run a hook (bypasses trust)
```

When a command skips hooks because the repo is untrusted, it prints one plain
stderr notice — e.g.
`Untrusted repo — 2 daft.yml hooks not run: worktree-pre-create, worktree-post-create`
— naming the skipped hooks and suggesting `daft hooks trust`. Each skip is
recorded; a later `daft hooks trust` lists precise replay commands
(`daft hooks run post-clone`, `daft hooks run worktree-post-create`) for the
worktrees whose setup never ran — run them inside each listed worktree. If you
see that notice, trusting and replaying is the way to get the worktree into its
fully set-up state.

### Manual Hook Execution

Run hooks on demand, bypassing trust (the user is explicitly invoking):

```bash
daft hooks run worktree-post-create              # Run all jobs
daft hooks run worktree-post-create --job "mise" # Run a single job
daft hooks run worktree-post-create --tag setup  # Run jobs tagged "setup"
daft hooks run worktree-post-create --dry-run    # Preview without executing
daft hooks run worktree-post-create --verbose    # Show skipped jobs + reasons
```

Use cases: re-running after a failure, iterating during hook development,
bootstrapping worktrees that predate the hooks config.

Post-hoc navigation: a failed hook prints an inspect breadcrumb
(`daft hooks jobs --last --hook <type>`). `daft hooks jobs --last [N]` shows the
newest invocation(s), `--failed` narrows to failing ones (sugar for
`--status failed`; `--status` values are validated at parse time), failed jobs
show their last output lines inline under the listing, and
`daft hooks jobs logs <job>` resolves a bare job name to its newest invocation
anywhere in the repo. On an interactive terminal, a gated `daft merge` renders
its pre/post-merge hooks as live rail sections (same `v` verbose toggle as
exec/run) instead of hiding them behind the spinner. Non-interactively, prefer
`daft merge --format json`: it reports the gate's verdict, why it refused, and
the job rows in one document instead of prose you would have to parse — see
Machine-Readable Output.

### Skipping Hooks Per-Invocation (`--skip-hooks`)

The worktree-creating commands (`daft start`, `daft go`, `daft clone`) and
`daft merge` accept `--skip-hooks` to exclude jobs for one run (repeatable or
comma-separated):

```bash
daft start feat/x --skip-hooks all           # skip every hook
daft start feat/x --skip-hooks tag:heavy,lint # skip tagged + named jobs
daft clone <url> --skip-hooks post-clone     # clone, run worktree hooks only
daft merge feat/x --skip-tag deep --no-edit  # fast gate pass (tag sugar)
```

`--skip-tag <TAG>` (on `merge`, `run`, and `hooks run`) is sugar for
`--skip-hooks tag:<TAG>`; `--only-tag <TAG>` is the include side (alias of
`--tag` on `run`/`hooks run`). On `daft merge` the selection filters hook JOBS
only — the committed gate policy checks always run.

Selectors: `all`/`*`, `<hook>` (a whole hook by its canonical `daft.yml` key,
e.g. `worktree-post-create`), `tag:<tag>`, `<name>` (a job), `job:<name>`
(explicit escape hatch). A bare token resolves wildcard → hook type → job name;
tags need the `tag:` prefix. Naming a hook the command never fires is a silent
no-op.

Key behavior — the **downstream cascade**: skipping a job also skips every job
that `needs:` it (transitively); upstream dependencies are untouched. Excluded
jobs are reported as skipped with a reason, never dropped silently; a selector
matching nothing warns and the run proceeds. `--skip-hooks` is the exclusion
counterpart to `daft hooks run --job/--tag`. `--skip-hooks all` cannot be
combined with `--trust-hooks`; partial skips can.

### Git pre-push Hooks on daft Pushes

Separate from daft's own hooks: every daft-initiated `git push` honors the
repo's git-level `pre-push` hook (native `.git/hooks` or `core.hooksPath`
managers like lefthook/husky/pre-commit), reported as a `pre-push` phase. A
failing hook blocks the push and the command exits non-zero — any worktree it
created is still completed and usable, and the error names the recovery command.
Exceptions — pushes that provably carry no content skip the hook by default
(`daft.pushVerify`: `auto` default, `always`, `never`): the automatic upstream
push on `daft start`/`daft go -b` runs the hook only when it introduces new
commits, and remote-branch deletes (`daft remove` with remote deletion on,
`daft rename`'s old-name cleanup, `daft merge`'s post-merge cleanup,
`daft multi-remote move --delete-old`) skip it outright since a delete pushes
zero objects. Set `daft.pushVerify always` when pre-push hooks enforce ref
policy (e.g. protected-branch delete guards); `daft.checkout.pushVerify`
overrides the base for the upstream push alone. Note that `never` is
unconditional, unlike `auto`/`always` which decide per push: setting
`daft.pushVerify never` to quiet deletes also disarms the hook on an upstream
push that does carry commits, so re-arm it with `daft.checkout.pushVerify auto`.
Pass `--no-verify` to the pushing command to skip the hook once — every pushing
command accepts it except `daft merge`, whose cleanup delete is governed by
`daft.pushVerify` alone. `--skip-hooks` does NOT affect git-level hooks — it
only filters daft's own jobs.

To push a branch from outside its worktree with the hook still running in the
RIGHT tree, use `daft push <branch>`: it resolves the branch's worktree and runs
the push (and therefore the shared hook) from there. Plain `git push` would run
the hook in whatever worktree you happen to be in.

Parallel `sync --push` hook runs are memory-governed (#678): a governor caps
concurrent hook-bearing pushes (default `max(2, cores/4)`; `--jobs N` overrides,
`--no-throttle` disables), learns each hook's peak memory across runs, throttles
admissions under memory pressure (rows show `held: memory`), and under sustained
pressure freezes then kills-and-retries the newest push rather than let the
machine swap. Each push unit also gets a wall-clock budget
(`daft.sync.pushTimeout`, default 30m) so a hung hook cannot wedge the sync.
`daft.sync.pushHookStrategy batched` pushes every branch in one `git push` so
the hook fires once with all refs (one refusal fails the whole batch).

The same governor covers parallel hook/task job phases (post-create fan-outs, a
merge gate's parallel rings): admission caps the fan-out, a shared jobserver
bounds intra-job build parallelism, and foreground jobs are never frozen or
killed. Gated merges additionally serialize per repository through a
cross-process lane — a second `daft merge` prints
`waiting for the merge gate lane — held by ...` and proceeds when the first
finishes; that wait is expected coordination, not a hang.

### Move Hooks

When a worktree moves (`daft rename`, `daft layout transform`), daft replays
identity-tracked hooks to tear down the old environment and set up the new one:
`worktree-pre-remove` + `worktree-post-remove` (old identity) → move on disk →
`worktree-pre-create` + `worktree-post-create` (new identity). Only tracked jobs
run.

```yaml
- name: link-output
  run: ln -sf {worktree_path}/dist /opt/builds/current
  tracks: [path] # Re-runs when the worktree path changes

- name: install-deps
  run: npm install
  # No tracks -- skipped during moves
```

If `tracks` is omitted, daft infers it from template usage (`{worktree_path}`
implies `path`; `{branch}` implies `branch`); explicit `tracks` overrides. Jobs
listed in a tracked job's `needs` are pulled into the move even if untracked.
Hook failures during moves warn but never block — the move always completes.
Move-only template variables `{old_worktree_path}`/`{old_branch}` and env vars
`DAFT_IS_MOVE`, `DAFT_OLD_WORKTREE_PATH`, `DAFT_OLD_BRANCH_NAME` are available.

### Environment Variables in Hooks

All hooks receive: `DAFT_HOOK`, `DAFT_COMMAND`, `DAFT_PROJECT_ROOT`,
`DAFT_GIT_DIR`, `DAFT_REMOTE`, `DAFT_SOURCE_WORKTREE`. Worktree hooks add
`DAFT_WORKTREE_PATH`, `DAFT_BRANCH_NAME`; creation hooks `DAFT_IS_NEW_BRANCH`,
`DAFT_BASE_BRANCH`; clone hooks `DAFT_REPOSITORY_URL`, `DAFT_DEFAULT_BRANCH`;
removal hooks `DAFT_REMOVAL_REASON` (`remote-deleted`, `manual`); move hooks
`DAFT_IS_MOVE`, `DAFT_OLD_WORKTREE_PATH`, `DAFT_OLD_BRANCH_NAME`.

For anonymous sandbox worktrees `DAFT_BRANCH_NAME` is the empty string (the
contract is "empty means no branch") and `DAFT_COMMIT` carries the pinned commit
OID; the `{worktree_slug}` template variable works unchanged and is the right
per-worktree handle for hooks serving both kinds.

## Warm Worktrees (`copy:` and `daft warm`)

A new worktree starts with no `node_modules/`, no `target/`, no build output at
all. A top-level `copy:` section in `daft.yml` (a sibling of `hooks:`) names the
gitignored paths daft replicates from the source worktree into each new one, so
worktrees start warm:

```yaml
copy:
  - target/
  - node_modules/
  - "**/dist/"
```

The map form adds knobs:

```yaml
copy:
  paths: [target/, node_modules/]
  fallback: copy # copy | skip — what to do when the filesystem cannot reflink
  max_size: 5GB # per-ENTRY cap; gates the byte-copy fallback only
```

- **The source is ranked against what the new worktree will hold**: the base
  branch's own worktree first (`daft start feat master` copies master's caches
  from wherever you typed it; with no base named the base is the branch you are
  on), then any worktree sitting at the identical commit — sandboxes and forks
  included — then the worktree you ran from. Ties at the identical commit go to
  where you are standing, then to the warmest. Two candidates never win: a stale
  entry `git worktree list` still reports after its directory was deleted, and
  an identical-commit match carrying none of the declared caches (it loses to a
  source that has them, but only ever to a warmer one). The rail's section
  anchor names the winner (`copied paths from 'master'`). The `copy:`
  **config**, unlike the bytes, is read from the worktree you are standing in —
  a visitor's untracked overlay lives there — so a standing worktree whose
  merged config lacks the key plans nothing.
- On a copy-on-write filesystem (APFS, btrfs, XFS `reflink=1`, OpenZFS 2.2+,
  bcachefs, ReFS) the replica is near-free until the copies diverge. Elsewhere
  `fallback:` decides: `copy` (default) pays for a real byte copy, `skip` leaves
  the entry out. `max_size` (`5GB`, `500MB`, or a plain byte count, quoted or
  not) caps that byte copy per entry and never applies to a reflink;
  `daft hooks validate` rejects one it cannot parse, and rejects a map form that
  declares no `paths:`.
- Entries are worktree-root-relative, may be files or directories, and may use
  glob metacharacters (`*`, `?`, `[`), expanded against the source worktree. An
  absolute path, a `..` component, or a path naming the worktree itself is
  refused.
- **Entries must be gitignored** — `git check-ignore` must pass _and_ nothing
  under the entry may be tracked. A violation is a per-entry warning, not an
  error. The check asks the **source** only: copying into a branch whose
  `.gitignore` lacks the entry leaves it as untracked content in that worktree's
  `git status`, so warn users whose ignore rules differ across branches.
- Special files (unix sockets, FIFOs, device nodes) are silently omitted from
  copies; regular files, directories, and — on Unix — symlinks are reproduced.
- `daft start --fork -n N` runs the stage once per fork: N near-free clones on a
  reflinking filesystem, but N real byte copies without one under
  `fallback: copy`.
- The stage runs before `shared:` symlinking and before `worktree-post-create`
  hooks, so a hook-driven `npm install` / `cargo build` hits a warm cache.
  Caches first, daft-managed links on top: linking creates the parent
  directories it needs, so running it first made a `shared:` path _inside_ a
  copied cache manufacture an empty scaffold the copy then skipped as
  `already present`.
- **It never aborts creation.** Every failure — tracked entry, unreadable
  source, full disk — is a warning row and the worktree is still created.
- **It never overwrites.** An entry already present at the destination is
  skipped, so the stage is idempotent. A destination of the wrong _shape_ is
  reported rather than skipped silently; only `daft warm --force` replaces it,
  and even then not when it is a symlink resolving outside the worktree.
- `daft clone` does not run it: a fresh clone has no source worktree to copy
  from. The first build belongs in a `post-clone` or `worktree-post-create`
  hook; worktrees branched off afterwards inherit it.
- `copy:` is read through the full config merge, so `daft.local.yml` and
  `extends:` files can declare or override it. An overlay replaces the key
  **wholesale** — paths and knobs together, never element-wise.
- **A machine can opt out**: `git config --global daft.copy.enabled false` (or
  per-repo, without `--global`) drops the stage from worktree creation entirely
  — for filesystems where a real byte copy costs more than the package manager
  would. It does not disable `daft warm`; running that command is the opt-in. If
  a worktree comes up cold and `copy:` is declared, check this key before
  reporting a bug.

`daft warm` replays the same declarations on demand — for a worktree created
before the `copy:` key existed, or after building something expensive that other
worktrees should have:

```bash
daft warm                 # warm the current worktree
daft warm feature-x       # warm that worktree
daft warm --from main     # name the source explicitly
daft warm --force         # replace entries that already exist in the target
daft warm -v              # add the engine's per-entry narration
```

Naming no target warms the current worktree; naming one warms that one. `--from`
names the source outright and is never second-guessed; without it the source is
ranked the same way creation ranks it, anchored on the commit the target already
sits at — a worktree holding that exact commit first, then where you stand, then
the default branch's worktree. Both slots (the target and `--from`) take a
worktree directory name, a branch name, or a path under the project root. The
result line names both resolved ends at ordinary verbosity
(`Copied 1 of 2 declared paths (1 KB) into 'develop' from 'main'`) — do not tell
users they need `-v` to see which pair ran; `-v` only adds engine narration.

It targets one worktree per run; to spread a fresh cache across several, run it
per worktree or drive it with `daft exec`.

`--force` is the only destructive form, and it still refuses: content the
**target** worktree tracks is never replaced, the bare container is refused as
either end, and nothing is removed until the copy is actually going to proceed —
so a refusal never lands over a cache already deleted.

What to tell users about expectations: a copied cache is a head start, not a
guarantee, because toolchains embed absolute paths to differing degrees. Expect
cargo's registry dependencies to survive the move and workspace-local crates to
rebuild; expect pnpm's symlink-heavy `node_modules/` to copy far more cheaply
than a flat npm/yarn tree (on Unix — daft does not replicate symlinks on
Windows, where such an entry fails, is cleaned up, and retries next run). Do
**not** suggest copying `.venv/` — a virtualenv records its own absolute path in
`pyvenv.cfg`, `bin/` shebangs, and `bin/activate`; share the uv/pip cache and
rebuild it instead, or create it with `uv venv --relocatable` first. The source
tree is read live and is not quiesced, so copying while a build writes into the
source yields a torn snapshot — re-run the build or `daft warm --force`.

## Tasks (`daft run`)

Tasks are named, user-invoked job groups — the **serve on demand** half of the
workflow. They live under a top-level `tasks:` section in `daft.yml` (a sibling
of `hooks:`) and run only when asked:

```yaml
hooks:
  worktree-post-create:
    jobs:
      - name: install
        run: pnpm install # provision: finite, idempotent, unattended

tasks:
  run: # reserved default — bare `daft run`
    parallel: true
    jobs:
      - name: backend
        run: docker compose up
        env:
          COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME: "api-{worktree_slug}"
      - name: web
        run: pnpm dev
        root: frontend
  seed-db: # `daft run seed-db`
    jobs:
      - name: seed
        run: ./scripts/seed.sh
```

- `daft run` — runs the reserved task named `run`
- `daft run <name>` — runs any task
- `daft run <name> <args>...` — words after the task name are shell-escaped and
  appended to the task's command (requires the task to resolve to a single
  foreground job; narrow multi-job tasks with `--job`)
- `daft run <args>...` — a first word naming no task forwards every word to the
  reserved `run` task (an unknown first word errors only when no `run` task
  exists to receive it); `daft run -- <args>...` forces forwarding past the name
  match
- Everything after the first word passes through verbatim, flags included —
  `daft run`'s own flags go before the task name
- `daft run --list` — lists the tasks with job counts
- `daft run --job <name>` / `--tag <tag>` — run a subset of the task's jobs

Tasks reuse the full job schema — `parallel`/`piped`/`follow`, `needs`, groups,
`env`, `root`, `skip`/`only`, `interactive`, `background`. Differences from
lifecycle hooks:

- **No execution timeout.** A task runs until it exits or is cancelled (hook
  jobs keep the 300s default) — the right home for dev servers and watchers.
- **Foreground and attended.** A single-job task passes the terminal straight
  through — the job's raw output, no wrapper. A multi-job task renders one live
  row per job with the logs threaded beneath. Ctrl+C cancels the job tree
  gracefully, a second Ctrl+C force-kills. There is no detach flag; jobs marked
  `background: true` still dispatch to the coordinator as usual (visible in
  `daft hooks jobs`).
- **Trust.** An explicit `daft run` counts as consent: it executes even in an
  untrusted repo, printing a `daft hooks trust` hint (same rule as
  `daft hooks run`).
- Task jobs receive `DAFT_TASK=<name>` in place of `DAFT_HOOK`, with
  `DAFT_COMMAND=run`.

Positioning: `daft exec` runs an ad-hoc command you type on the spot; `daft run`
runs a named task committed in `daft.yml` (npm's `exec`/`run` split). Prefer a
task over hand-launching a server when one is defined.

## Environment Tools and Suggested Automation

When working in a daft repo, detect environment tools by their marker files and
suggest `daft.yml` hooks that automate setup for new worktrees.

For per-worktree ports and derived names (compose project names, DB names),
suggest a declared `env:` section rather than hand-rolled hashing scripts — see
the `daft env` row in Management and the `env:` key in the daft.yml Format
section. Shell integration is one `.envrc` line: `eval "$(daft env --export)"`.

| Tool       | Marker Files                                      | Purpose                                                 |

| npm        | `package.json`, `package-lock.json`               | Node.js dependencies                                    |
| yarn       | `yarn.lock`                                       | Node.js dependencies (Yarn)                             |
| pnpm       | `pnpm-lock.yaml`                                  | Node.js dependencies (pnpm)                             |
| pip        | `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`  | Python dependencies                                     |
| Cargo      | `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`                        | Rust dependencies                                       |
| Go modules | `go.mod`, `go.sum`                                | Go dependencies                                         |
| Bundler    | `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`                         | Ruby dependencies                                       |

A combined example for a project using mise, direnv, and npm — `post-clone` runs
once at clone, `worktree-post-create` for every new worktree:

```yaml
hooks:
  post-clone:
    piped: true
    jobs:
      - name: mise-install
        run: mise install
      - name: direnv-allow
        run: direnv allow .
      - name: setup-env
        run: cp .env.example .env

  worktree-post-create:
    jobs:
      - name: mise-install
        run: mise install
      - name: direnv-allow
        run: direnv allow .
      - name: npm-install
        run: npm install
        needs: [mise-install]
```

Most tools are one-liners (`mise install`, `direnv allow .`, `npm install`,
`cargo build`, `go mod download`). Two need care:

```yaml
# nvm is a shell function -- source it first
- name: nvm-use
  run: |
    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
    nvm install

# Python: create the venv before installing into it
- name: pip-install
  run: |
    python -m venv .venv
    . .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When a daft-managed repo has no `daft.yml`, check for dependency markers and
suggest creating one — a `worktree-post-create` hook that installs dependencies
is the highest-impact automation. After suggesting a `daft.yml`, remind the user
to trust the repo: `daft hooks trust`.

The same markers usually imply a `copy:` section too — `Cargo.toml` implies
`target/`, a lockfile implies `node_modules/`. Suggest both together: the hook
does the work, and `copy:` makes each new worktree start from a warm cache
instead of an empty one. See Warm Worktrees above.

## Workflow Guidance for Agents

When working in a daft-managed repository, apply these translations:

| User intent                       | Correct daft approach                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Create a branch"                 | `daft start <name>` — creates branch + worktree                                                               |
| "Branch from main"                | `daft start <name> main` — branches from the specified base                                                   |
| "Create a branch in another repo" | `daft start <repo> <name>` — creates it there; shell lands in the worktree                                    |
| "Switch to branch X"              | Navigate to the worktree directory: `cd ../X/`                                                                |
| "Go back"                         | `daft go -` — toggles to the previous worktree                                                                |
| "Check out a PR"                  | `daft go pr:<number>` — fork-aware, via `gh`/`glab`; also `mr:<number>` or a pasted PR/MR URL                 |
| "Delete a branch"                 | `daft remove <branch>` — removes worktree + local branch                                                      |
| "Clean up branches"               | `daft prune` — removes worktrees for deleted, merged remote branches; never-published branches are left alone |
| "Wrong branch"                    | `daft carry <correct-branch>` — moves uncommitted changes                                                     |
| "Update from remote"              | `daft update` — updates current or specified worktrees (`source:dest` too)                                    |
| "Merge my branch"                 | `daft merge <branch> --into main --no-edit`                                                                   |
| "Run my build on these worktrees" | `daft exec feat/a feat/b -- <cmd>` or `daft exec --all -- <cmd>`                                              |
| "Start the dev server / stack"    | `daft run` — runs the reserved `run` task from `daft.yml`, if one exists                                      |
| "Adopt existing repo"             | `daft layout transform contained` — restructures a plain clone into daft's layout, carrying its working tree  |

### Per-worktree Isolation

Each worktree has its **own** `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `target/`, etc. A new
worktree created without `daft.yml` hooks has nothing installed — if the user
hits missing-dependency errors there, run the appropriate install command in
that worktree (`npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, ...).

Runtime resources deconflict the same way: if the repo declares an `env:`
section in `daft.yml`, every worktree has its own deterministic port block and
derived names. Read them with `daft env` (`daft env WEBAPP_PORT` for one raw
value) instead of hardcoding ports; commands daft spawns (hooks, tasks,
`daft exec`) already have them in the environment. Cross-repo work uses the
address form: `daft env backend:API_PORT` answers for the backend repo's
worktree matching this one's name — even before that worktree exists.

### Navigating Worktrees

From any worktree, sibling worktrees are at `../<branch-name>/` and the project
root is at `..`. Use `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` to find the root
programmatically.

### Modifying Shared Files

Tracked files (`.gitignore`, CI config) live in each worktree independently;
changes propagate only by committing and merging. `daft.yml` is different when
it is untracked — a **visitor configuration** — in which case daft itself
propagates it:

- **Three states**: tracked / visitor (untracked) / missing. Every untracked
  daft file daft writes is recorded as that worktree's **seed**; the on-disk
  copy is later classified as pristine (untouched), refined (edited — real user
  data), or no-seed (treated like refined).
- **Branch-out**: creating a worktree copies in-scope untracked daft files from
  the source worktree before `worktree-post-create` hooks fire.
- **`daft merge`**: pristine source copies are skipped; a refined source is
  merged three-way (seed as base) into the target before the git merge,
  atomically, announcing adopted keys. Keys changed on both sides prompt
  interactively; non-interactive runs abort pointing at `daft file merge`.
- **Removal** (`daft remove`): pristine copies delete silently; refined copies
  stop the removal — interactively offering consolidate / discard / abort;
  non-interactively refusing with a `daft file merge` suggestion. Forcing (`-f`)
  discards to `<git-common-dir>/.daft/discarded/<branch>/`.
- **`daft prune` / `daft sync`** never prompt: pristine copies prune cleanly,
  refined ones keep their worktree with an end-of-run summary pointing at
  `daft file merge`; `--force` discards to the stash.
- The default-branch worktree's config is only written by an announced merge
  consolidation or an explicit `daft file merge` — never by a removal path.
  Doctor surfaces each config's classification as informational.

### `daft file merge` — consolidate configs

`daft file merge <TARGET> <SOURCE>` (or `daft file merge <SOURCE>`) consolidates
one daft file into another. With seed provenance the merge is three-way: only
genuine refinements move, a key-level preview prints first, the target is backed
up to `<git-common-dir>/.daft/backups/file-merge/`, and conflicting keys need a
side (interactive prompt, `-y` for source-wins, or a non-zero abort listing the
keys). Without provenance, a legacy two-way merge applies (source wins). The
source file is deleted afterward unless `--keep-source`. Use it to consolidate
visitor configs before removing a worktree or to promote one to a team baseline.

### `daft repo install` — bootstrap a config

`daft repo install` writes a starter `daft.yml` (commented skeleton: `hooks:`,
`shared:`, `copy:`, `layout:`) at the worktree root. It is repo-aware: from a
worktree subdir it targets the worktree root; at the bare container root of a
contained layout it installs across the repo's worktrees (never a stray file at
the inert container root); it refuses only outside a git repository. If a
`daft.yml` already exists it reports whether that file is tracked (team
baseline) or a visitor config and stops cleanly (exit 0). It then offers to add
`/daft.yml` to `.git/info/exclude` (local, never committed) so a visitor config
stays private: prompted on a TTY (default No), `--git-exclude` adds it without
prompting, non-interactive runs print a copy-pasteable hint. It never touches
the tracked `.gitignore`. `daft install` is a top-level alias for the same
command.

## Machine-Readable Output

Commands emitting structured output via `--format`: flat-list (`list`,
`hooks jobs`, `hooks trust list`, `layout list`, `repo list`, `config list`),
document (`release-notes`, `repo info`, `config get`, `config set`,
`config unset`), matrix (`shared status`), sectioned (`merge`,
`multi-remote status`, `hooks run` listing mode). Valid formats: `json`,
`ndjson`, `tsv`, `csv`, `yaml`, `toon`, `markdown`.
`--template '<tera-template>'` renders custom output (`{{ var }}`, `{% for %}`,
`{% if %}`). Document and sectioned payloads support only `json`, `yaml`,
`toon`, `markdown` — the row formats have no rows to fill.

**`daft merge --format json`** (start mode only; the finish modes reject it)
returns sections `verdict`, `sources`, `conflicts` (only when conflicted), and
`jobs` (the gate's per-job rows). Branch on `verdict[0].status`: `landed`,
`up-to-date`, `squash-staged` exit 0; `refused` (gate policy stopped it, repo
untouched — `verdict[0].refusal` names which policy), `gate-failed` (a check
came back red; read the `jobs` section), `conflicted`, `commit-aborted`, and
`failed` exit 1. A merge that landed but whose cleanup was refused reports
`landed` with `cleanup: "refused"` and still exits 1. `pre_merge_invocation`
joins to `daft hooks jobs --last --hook pre-merge --format json` for the full
job detail and logs. The flag never changes the exit code — checking `$?` alone
stays valid.

**`daft config` output contract**: `--local` and `--global` name one layer, and
the same layer whether reading or writing — `get --local` prints what
`set --local` would replace, which for a `daft.yml` setting is the
`daft.local.yml` overlay and for the layout is the repository's own entry. A
read narrowed to a layer exits 1 when that layer says nothing, so it answers "is
this set here?" rather than "what does it resolve to?". Two properties let a
script skip flag bookkeeping: a read's document **always** carries `layers`,
`diagnostics`, and `writable_scopes` (so `--origin` is a human affordance, never
required), and `--format` **never** changes the exit code — a silent layer emits
its document and still exits 1. `value` is the asked-for layer's own when
narrowed, `effective` is always the resolved one, and `outranked_by` names any
higher layer in the way. A write's record carries `written[]` (`key`, `value`,
`changed`, `file`) plus `store` — which is not always the scope's name, since a
`daft.yml` setting's "global" is the repository's committed file — and, for a
behavior, the `state` it ended in. `changed: false` marks an unset that found
nothing. Reading a behavior at one layer works only when that layer sets every
member (which is what a behavior write does); a partial layer exits 1 rather
than reporting the nearest state.

`daft start --fork` has its own fixed stdout contract, no `--format` needed: the
created worktree path(s), bare, one per line (everything else on stderr).
`wt=$(daft start --fork)` captures it directly.

**`daft list` output contract**: table columns show branch (`✦` marks the
default branch), path (relative to cwd), base ahead/behind, file status (`!N`
conflicted, `+N` staged, `-N` unstaged, `?N` untracked), remote status (`⇡N`
unpushed, `⇣N` unpulled), branch age, owner, and commit info. When `user.email`
is configured, output splits into two sections (your branches / other branches)
per the resolved owner. `--format json` fields include `is_default_branch`,
`staged`, `unstaged`, `untracked`, `conflicted`, `operation`, `identity_source`,
`remote_ahead`, `remote_behind`, `branch_age`, `owner_name`, `owner_email`; the
`owner` field is `{name, email}` or `null`.

**Paused operations and detached HEAD**: a worktree keeps its branch name while
git has HEAD detached to run an operation — mid-rebase the row still names the
branch and keeps its branch-keyed fields, rather than reporting `(detached)`.
`operation` names the paused operation (`rebase`, `merge`, `cherry-pick`,
`revert`, `bisect`, `am`, or `null`), `conflicted` counts unresolved files
(never double-counted as staged and unstaged), and `identity_source` says how
the name was established: `attached` (checked out), `recovered` (read from the
paused operation), `persisted` (daft's record of what the worktree was created
for), or `none`. `is_sandbox` is true only for a detached checkout that no
operation explains — so a rebasing worktree is **not** a sandbox. The `status`
column (`--columns +status`) renders the same state as words
(`rebasing · 2 conflicts`, `rebasing · resolved`, `detached @ <sha>`,
`drifted`). `daft list --merging` filters to worktrees mid-_merge_ only, not any
operation.

**`daft hooks jobs` output**: a flat table with one row per job carrying
invocation context (`invocation_id`, `invocation_short`, `worktree`,
`hook_type`, `trigger_command`, `invocation_created_at`) plus `size_bytes` for
the job's `output.log`.

**Column selection (`--columns`)** on `list`/`sync`/`prune`: default columns
`annotation`, `branch`, `path`, `base`, `changes`, `remote`, `age`, `owner`,
`last-commit`; optional `size` (adds a total footer) and `hash`. `daft list`
also offers `status` (paused operation and conflict state in words), which sorts
before `branch`; it is list-only, since sync and prune pin their own
task-progress column of that name. On all three, `pr` is also a default
(`#N`/`!N` for PR/MR checkouts and for local branches with an open or merged PR)
— but only in repos with a GitHub/GitLab remote, and daft silently drops it
while the forge integration is broken in a way needing user action (gh/glab
missing or unauthenticated; it returns after a successful refresh — do not treat
the column's absence as an error). `--columns +pr` forces it regardless. While
the `pr` column shows, `daft list` also adds a row for every open PR the table
doesn't already represent (`sync`/`prune` show the column on their worktree rows
without adding rows): PR-bearing local branches appear without `-b`
(`"kind": "branch"` in json), and PRs with no local presence — colleagues'
branches, fork PRs — appear as rows built from forge data (`"kind": "pr"`; fork
rows named `owner:branch`; the PR title in the commit-subject field).
Merged/closed PRs decorate rows but never add one. Branch and PR rows report the
PR author as their owner; worktree rows keep the locally deduced owner (name and
email). Expect these extra rows when parsing default list output — filter by
`kind`, or pass `--columns -pr`, which removes the rows and the column as one
unit, for a worktrees-only listing. In piped/`NO_COLOR` output — what agents
read — the PR's cached fate trails as a glyph: `✓`/`✗`/`●` CI pass/fail/running,
`◆` merged, `○` closed; in a color terminal the number's color carries the same
states instead (green/red/yellow, purple merged, dim closed). The cache
refreshes in the background via `daft update`/`daft sync` and on listing with
the column; prefer `--format json` (`pr_state`, `ci_status`, `pr_url` fields —
present in the default schema even when the table hides the column) over parsing
glyphs. Two modes — replace (`--columns name,path,age`: exactly those, in order)
and modifier (`--columns +size,-age`: adjust defaults; auto-detected when every
entry starts with `+`/`-`). The `status` column is always pinned on
`sync`/`prune`. Persistent defaults: `git config daft.<cmd>.columns`.

**Sorting (`--sort`)** on `list`/`sync`/`prune`: columns `name`, `path`, `size`,
`age`, `owner`, `hash`, `activity`, `commit`; prefix `+` ascending (default) /
`-` descending; comma-separate for multi-level (`--sort +owner,-size`).
`activity` counts committed and uncommitted changes; `commit` (alias
`last-commit`) only commit time. Sorting by hidden columns works. Persistent
defaults: `git config daft.<cmd>.sort`.

**Caches**: `daft list` writes content-addressed JSON caches under
`<git-common-dir>/.daft/cache/` — safe to delete at any time; daft re-populates.
`Changes`/`Size` cells always recompute and show the `·` skeleton glyph until
the result arrives.

## Configuration Reference

**Local-first defaults**: daft does not contact the remote by default. Remote
operations are opt-in via `daft config set remote-sync on` (or the individual
keys below); `--local` on any command suppresses remote operations for a single
invocation.

**Branch ownership** scopes the two-section split in `daft list` and limits
`daft sync --rebase`/`--push` to branches you own (matching `user.email`);
`--include <email>`/`--include unowned` overrides. Ownership is deduced from the
`base..branch` commit range by the configured strategy — the default
`recency-plurality` weights each commit by recency, staying robust to drive-by
commits.
